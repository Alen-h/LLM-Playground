cd LLM-Playground
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Usage

1. **Manage API Keys**: 
   - Enter your API key in the input field (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, or Deepseek)
   - Keys are automatically saved to local storage for future use
   - Use the dropdown to quickly select from previously saved keys
   - Delete unwanted keys with the trash icon

2. **Select Your Model**: 
   - Click the model selector to open the cascading dropdown
   - First select your provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Deepseek)
   - Then choose your specific model from the available options

3. **Configure Your Prompts**:
   - **System Prompt**: Define the AI's behavior, role, and context (up to 10000 characters)
   - **User Prompt**: Enter your question or request (up to 1000 characters)
   - Both fields include real-time character counters

4. **Fine-tune Parameters**:
   - **Temperature**: Control randomness (0 = focused, 2 = creative)
   - **Max Tokens**: Set response length limit (1-4096 tokens)
   - **Response Format**: Choose text or JSON output (OpenAI/Deepseek only)

5. **Submit & Review**:
   - Click Submit when all required fields are filled
   - View real-time loading indicators
   - Review formatted responses in the output panel
   - Handle any errors with clear, descriptive messages

## Architecture

This project uses the **Strategy Pattern** to handle multiple LLM providers:

- **LLMProvider**: Abstract base class defining the provider interface
- **ClaudeProvider**: Handles Anthropic Claude models
- **DeepseekProvider**: Handles Deepseek models
- **OpenAIProvider**: Handles OpenAI models (also serves as fallback)
- **LLMProviderFactory**: Factory class that selects the appropriate provider

This design makes it easy to add new LLM providers without modifying existing code.

## Configuration

### Response Formats

- `text` - Plain text responses
- `json_object` - Structured JSON output (OpenAI and Deepseek only)

### Parameters

- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (0-2, default: 1)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum response length (default: 2048)
- **System Prompt**: Defines AI behavior and context

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored only in your browser's local storage
- API calls are made server-side to protect your API keys from client exposure
- No API keys or conversation data are stored on our servers
- Each provider's API key is stored separately and securely

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Next.js and Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code linting

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for local development. All API keys are managed through the UI.

## Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on Vercel with the included `vercel.json` configuration.

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```
